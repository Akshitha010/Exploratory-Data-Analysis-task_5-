# 🧠 Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the exploratory data analysis performed on the Titanic dataset as part of **Task 5** of the Data Analyst Internship. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in passenger survival using visual and statistical techniques.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `Exploratory_data_analysis(task5).ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing full EDA with code, plots, and insights.
- `EDA(task5).pdf` – A polished PDF report summarizing the entire EDA on the Titanic dataset.
- `titanic.zip` – Zipped folder containing the original dataset (`train.csv`) used for analysis.
- `README.md` – Overview of the project, objectives, insights, and file descriptions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Explore and visualize the Titanic dataset.
- Understand the factors influencing passenger survival.
- Apply Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to conduct professional data analysis.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python (via Google Colab)**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and exploration
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for writing and running analysis interactively

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Gender was a major factor** in survival — females had a significantly higher survival rate.
- **Class mattered** — passengers in 1st class had the highest survival rate.
- **Higher fare** was generally associated with better survival chances.
- **Children (age < 10)** had improved survival odds, indicating rescue priority.

---

## 📊 Types of Analysis Performed

- **Univariate Analysis** – Distributions of age, fare, class, gender, and survival.
- **Bivariate Analysis** – Comparative survival by gender, age, and class.
- **Multivariate Analysis** – Correlation heatmap and pairplots for pattern discovery.
